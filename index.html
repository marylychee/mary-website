            <h2>Where do I come from?</h2>

            <p><span>B</span>orn on the Gold Coast in Australia, I was brought up in a beautiful city flourishing from the real estate and tourism industry.</p>

            <p>I wasn't interested in a retirement lifestyle. I was bored and wanted to be where there was more learning, growth,  inspiration and challenge, where perhaps I was connected to the greater world and it's communities. I was interested in nutrition and psychology so I decided to move an hour north and study in Brisbane. It was whilst studying Health Sciences that I found work at the local startup studio, <a href="https://www.pitchblak.co">Pitchblak</a>.

            <div id="wrapper">
                <img src="assets/images/Pitchblak.jpg" alt="work friends">
            </div>

            <h2>Creative entrepreneurship</h2>

            <p>I began blending my learnings from nutrition and psychology, with my learnings at work in business stratgey, social media marketing, lead generation and operations. Everything cross-pollinated and I started visualising ways to make health care better, starting by focusing on people. I went to meetups and Student Market Days at Health Colleges where I pitched ideas, asked questions, and collected emails for web platform ideas.</p>

            <div id="wrapper">
                <img src="assets/images/Endeavour%20College.jpg" alt="work friends">
            </div>

            <p>With just enough insight, empathy and ideas, I won my first Startup Weekend in March 2016 back when I didn't even know a line of code. I did, however, deeply understand the problems from within nutrition clinics, where current software may be lagging or lacking. With a group of hackers and hustlers, we built an app that streamlined nutritional analysis by tapping into Clarafai's image recognition API.</p>

            <h2>Coding and Hacking</h2>
            
            <p>Since then I've been hooked and have been learning programming with my friends in Brisbane.</p>

            <p>This is me at attended Django Girls learning Python and Git.</p>

            </div>


            <p>And this is me at a Code Retreat in Bali learning Html, CSS and Javascript.</p>

            </div>

            <p>I also attend and organise tech and startup events in Brisbane. I organised a screening of CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap at our local cinemas and I hosted a Q&A panel afterwards with Brisbane startup founders, entrepreneurs and programmers.</p>

            <h2>Dancing, Jamming and Painting</h2>
            
            <p>When I'm not coding, what do I get up to? I am probably biking, painting, reading or dancing. I use to do a lot of salsa dancing but have expanded to do more hip hop these days.</p>

            <p>This is me dancing salsa in Bali.</p>

            <div id="wrapper">
                <img src="assets/images/salsainbali.jpg" alt="dancing salsa">
            </div>

            <p> I commited to learning hip hop for 2 months and signing up for my first on stage performance at the Judith Wright Center in Brisbane and then back stage afterwards. </p>

                <img src="assets/images/hiphopcrew.jpg" alt="hiphop">
            </div>

            <p>I had started learning javascript at the same time that I started learning hip hop. I'd reasoned that the best way to learn something challenging was to throw myself in and totally immerse myself even if I feel like a dork with hip hop moves. With hip hop that meant to commitming myself to 3 or 4 hip hop classes a week and signing up to a performance in 2 months time. With web development that meant learning basic html, css and javascript and committimg myself to learning enough to attend a programming bootcamp like Galvanize.</p>
            
            <p>Also I paint.</p>
