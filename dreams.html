    <h2>Health Tech Entrepreneurship</h2>      
        
        <p>I want to work with founders, developers and teams in health tech startups. I want to make things that empower and heal the people.</p>
        
        <div id="wrapper">
            <img  src="assets/images/CodeDoc16.jpg" alt="Brisbane founders  and coders laughing" >
        </div> 
        
        
        <p>I think we need massively shift healthcare towards prevention, proaction, vitality and longevity. I think that our health of the planet and communities is a reflection of our collective wellbeing and vitality... and the decisions and the choices that we make that stem from that. We can no longer function as a largely reactive  business and community. Just because we are making profit  doesn't means it's the best or most helpful way. We need to start by focusing on the underlying problems. We can do better and we can do earlier. We don't need to wait until people are sick or things are really damaged to really care about health and wellbeing.</p>
        
        <p>I want to learn how sucessful startups are built and sustained. I want to become the kind of person that can make positive changes in the world and in the health industries, to elevate wellbeing of all people in the world. </p>
        
        <p>I believe that as we gain more awareness of our connectiveness  through the internet, we gain empathy and a feeling of personal  responsibility in that we are in this together. I think tech should be used less to distract and fragment attention but to more empower and collaborate on good intentions.</p>

    <p>I hope to study well and rigorously at Galvanize. I hope to embrace discomfort and challenge. I hope to grow in technical acumen. I'd like to continue to build on the ideas that I've gathered from exploring the health system with a sense of family and friendship. I want to continue to listen more than I talk.</p>

    <p>From Brisbane and Sydney, Australia, to the people in San Francisco, USA -I hope to learn from directly and viscerally from real life experiences with people and friends. I want to make meaningful friendships with key influencers and those with the best of intentions in the tech startup scenes. I want to immerse myself within the beehive of the tech ecosystems in San Francisco and around the world.</p>

    <p>I plan to work either in health tech startups or build them, to focus attention and energy towards improving, empowering and healing people, holistically and sustainabily around the world. </p>
       
    <p>These GIFs represent how I feel about starting at Galvanize.</p>
